#+STARTUP: showeverything
*** Warning: this project is for personal purposes only

I need it to be public so I can load =bundle.js=, produced by =webpack=-ing https://www.gitlab.com/spellcard199/quiversinapot-mxgraph, using a bookmarklet.

In case you decided to run any code in this repository, I decline responsibility for any damage it may cause.

*** How to use

1. Make new bookmarklet:
     1. Add any page to bookmarks (optionally, give it a meaningful name like "loadQipmx")
     2. Change bookmark's URL to: 
     #+BEGIN_SRC javascript
     javascript:fetch("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spellcard199/quiversinapot-mxgraph-dist/master/bundle.js", {cache: "no-store"}).then(res => res.text()).then(txt => {eval(txt); window.qipmx.loadPlugin(false)})
     #+END_SRC
2. In a diagrams.net's diagram, click on the bookmark

*** If Quiversinapot-mxgraph is on gitlab.com, why use github.com for this?

On gitlab.com, raw files are "CORS blocked", while on github.com they are not.
